## Roadmap:

### ver. 0.0.1
- barebones UI
- login page
- view list of groups
- basic chat (no one is an admin)
- create a plan/event (all plan details are entered manually)

### Milestone: ver. 0.1
#### Features:
- post login, above where the list of groups is displayed, add a widget which shows the upcoming and current events that are happening
- in the context of an event/plan, there will be another group chat, separate from the original group. in this scenario, the person who
  created the plan is an admn of sorts, or the event/plan _organizer_ or _leader_. This person can choose to give up their status to another
  friend
- chat polls
- Hip pocket: incremental update to make the UI look _slightly_ better, nothing major


### Future features:
- instead of manually entering the plan details, first present a list of suggested plans based on things like
  everyone's location, or the last place they went to, or finding similar places, or by the group's general interests
- notification reminders
- user can opt to do google calendar integration
- google maps integration to find the spot which is in the middle for everyone
- sponsored recommendations for where the group should hang out
- carpooling/ who is giving a ride?
- friends who join the plan can pool money for something like a movie, or restaurant, which goes to the event planner
