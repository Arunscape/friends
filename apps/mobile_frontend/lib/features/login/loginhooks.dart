// First, you ask for their email, then call isuser. This tells you if they need to sign in, or sign up. If they sign up, you ask for a name, and profile picture on top of that email, if it's signing in, you don't need any more info. Once you've collected all the info, you call either signin, or signup. This returns a temporary token which you store. It also sends an email, with a link. The user then needs to click on the link. Then, once the link has been clicked. The app can call upgrade to get a full length token. It will only return this new token if the user has clicked that link. Then the user is signed in. Every other request in the app should use that token
// Then at any point, you can use the signout method to invalid the token
